# Manito Auth Callback - Email Verification Success Handler

Enterprise-grade email verification success page for Manito marketplace.

## Files to Deploy

Upload these files to your auth-callback repository:

- `verified.html` - Main success page with Chilean-optimized UX
- `api/verified.js` - API handler for serving the success page
- `vercel.json` - Routing configuration for Vercel deployment

## How to Deploy

1. **Upload to GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the auth-callback repo
   git clone https://github.com/ManitoCL/auth-callback.git
   cd auth-callback

   # Add the new files
   cp /path/to/verified.html .
   cp /path/to/api/verified.js ./api/
   cp /path/to/vercel.json .

   # Commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add enterprise email verification success page"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically deploy** the changes since it's connected to the GitHub repo.

3. **Test the endpoint**:
   - Visit: `https://auth.manito.cl/verified`
   - Should show the success page

No environment variables needed - this is a static success page with client-side JavaScript.

The edge function `enterprise-signup` now redirects verification links to:
```
https://auth.manito.cl/verified
```

After verification, users must still log in with their password for security.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 errors**: Make sure `vercel.json` routing is properly deployed
- **Deep link not working**: Ensure the app is installed and deep links are configured
- **Page not loading**: Check Vercel deployment logs

## Security Notes

- Links expire in 15 minutes
- Post-verification login required
- Provider-specific security warnings
- No sensitive data stored client-side
